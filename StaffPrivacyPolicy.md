# Staff Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 14th 2025

This Staff Privacy Policy is an extension of our Privacy Policy (https://github.com/happyjeffery88/AFBlegal/blob/main/PrivacyPolicy.md), specifically designed for individuals applying for or currently serving as staff members on our server. It provides additional details on how we handle and use the information collected during the staff application and onboarding process.

Members of the server who are not applying for a staff position are not required to read this policy. However, you are welcome to review it to gain insight into how we manage staff-related data and ensure a secure and transparent environment for our team.

This policy reflects our commitment to trust, compliance with server rules, and adherence to legal obligations. It outlines the expectations, responsibilities, and protections associated with being a member of our staff.

## Information We Collect
As part of the application and onboarding process, we collect the following information:
  - Discord Username and Discord ID: Required to identify and communicate with applicants and staff.
  - Phone Number (Optional): If provided, this is used solely for emergency communication or verification purposes.
  - Google Form Answers: Responses submitted through the application form, including any additional information provided.
  - **Non-Personally Identifiable Information**: Includes server activity logs, moderation actions, and audit trails related to your staff responsibilities.

## How We Use Your Information
The information collected is used for:
  - Evaluating your application to determine if you meet the requirements to join our staff team.
  - Verifying your identity and role as staff.
  - Communication regarding server-related activities and responsibilities.
  - Auditing, administrative purposes, logging, and tracking moderation actions.
  - Improving the server and troubleshooting technical issues.

## Confidentiality
All collected information, including Google Form answers, is treated as confidential and is only accessible to authorized team members (e.g., bot developers). We will not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties, except as required by law.

## Accuracy of Information
It is your responsibility to provide accurate and truthful information. If incorrect or false data is submitted, we will provide an opportunity for you to correct it. Failure to amend the inaccuracies within a reasonable timeframe may result in removal from your position or disqualification from the application process.

## Data Retention
We retain your information for the following purposes:
  - Temporary Data: Data used for evaluating your application will be deleted if your application is unsuccessful.
  - Permanent Data: Data related to server audits, moderation actions, and staff responsibilities may be retained for compliance or legal purposes.
  - Retention Period: Data not required for long-term purposes will be deleted within 6 months

## Security Measures
We take data protection seriously and implement the following measures to protect your information:
  - **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted during storage and transmission.
  - **Access Control**: Only bot developers and authorized administrators have access to staff data.
  - **Data Breach Handling**: In case of a data breach, we will notify affected individuals and take immediate corrective actions to secure the data.


## Staff 2FA Requirement
All members of the staff team with **moderation powers or above** are required to enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** on their accounts. This is to enhance security and protect your account from unauthorized access.

Failure to enable 2FA may result in restricted access to moderation tools or, in some cases, removal from the staff team until compliance is achieved.

## GDPR Compliance
If you are located in a region subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have additional rights, including:
  - The right to access, rectify, or delete your data.
  - The right to data portability.
  - The right to restrict or object to data processing under certain conditions.

## Policy Changes
This Staff Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Staff will be notified of significant changes through:
    - Bot Changelogs.
    - Announcements in the staff section of our Discord server.

We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your data.

## Your Rights
You have the right to:
  - Request a copy of your information.
  - Ask for corrections to any inaccurate data.
  - Request the deletion of your information, provided itâ€™s not needed for ongoing investigations or legal matters.

However, you **cannot opt-out of necessary information**, including the information we collect for operational, auditing, and security purposes as outlined in the **Information We Collect** section. This data is essential for the functioning of the server and staff responsibilities.

For **optional information**, such as your phone number or any additional details you provided in the form, you may opt-out or request removal at any time. We encourage you to provide only the data necessary for the role you are applying for, but if you choose to provide optional information, you have the right to request its deletion.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details below.
