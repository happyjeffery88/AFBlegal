## Information We Collect  
Agro Farming collects limited data necessary to provide its services, including:  
  - Discord User IDs  
  - Server IDs  
  - Usage logs, such as command inputs  

This information is essential for maintaining and improving the Bot's functionality and user experience.  

## How We Use Data  
The data we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:  
  - Ensuring the Bot operates as intended.  
  - Supporting commands and features, such as displaying user-specific information (e.g., balance or account status).  
  - Debugging errors and improving features.  
  - Responding to user queries and support requests.  

**We do not sell or share your data with third parties except as required by law or to protect the Bot's integrity and security.**
