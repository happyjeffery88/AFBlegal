## Information We Collect
Asian Farming Bank collects limited data necessary to provide its services, including:
  - Discord User IDs
  - Server IDs
  - Usage logs, such as command inputs

This information is essential for maintaining and improving the Bot's functionality and user experience.

## How We Use Data
The data we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:
  - Ensuring the Bot operates as intended.
  - Supporting commands and features, such as displaying user-specific information (e.g., balance or account status).
  - Debugging errors and improving features.
  - Responding to user queries and support requests.

**We do not sell or share your data with third parties except as required by law or to protect the Bot's integrity and security.**


## Children's Privacy
Asian Farming Bank is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that such information has been inadvertently collected, we will take steps to delete it promptly. Parents or guardians can contact us at **afbotdev@gmail.com** to request the removal of such data.

## Data Protection
We implement reasonable measures to protect user data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute data security. Users should exercise caution and avoid sharing sensitive personal information through the Bot.

## User Rights
You have the right to:
- Request information about the data we collect.
- Request data deletion.

To exercise these rights, contact us at **afbotdev@gmail.com**. Please note that certain data may be retained as required by law or for operational purposes.

## Data Retention
We retain collected data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Once data is no longer required, we securely delete or anonymize it.

## Third-Party Services
Asian Farming Bank may integrate with third-party services (e.g., Discord). These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage users to review them. We are not responsible for how third-party services handle user data.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in the Bot or legal requirements. Updates will be communicated through Discord announcements and in-bot alerts. Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
